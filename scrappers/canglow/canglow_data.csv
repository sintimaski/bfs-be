"Light-Touch Enclosed Blinds","The ergonomically considered design of Light-Touch Enclosed blinds places the fingertip control within easy reach.","Light-Touch Enclosed Blinds","No detail has been overlooked in our line of Light-Touch Enclosed Blinds. The ergonomically considered design places the fingertip control within easy reach. A single operation lets you tilt the blinds and raise and lower them the entire length of the door glass, with only the slightest movement required. Even the operator is made to naturally fit the fingertip. An innovative design results in stacked blinds that take up the smallest of space at the top of the door glass when fully opened. Privacy channels on each side of the door glass eliminate light gaps when the blinds are closed, including streetlight shadows or sunlight glare.","https://www.odl.com/doorglass_detail/light-touch_enclosed_blinds","","","","","","https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/LightTouch%20Blinds/ODL_2020_RLBExtApp_ProductImage.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/LightTouch%20Blinds/ODL_2012_RLBOperator_ProductSlider.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/LightTouch%20Blinds/ODL_2012_RLBExtApp_ProductSlider.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/LightTouch%20Blinds/ODL_2012_RLBOperator2_ProductSlider.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Glass%20Textures/Clear.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/672-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/672-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/684-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/684-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/684-TRLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/607-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/624-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/624-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/687-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/687-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/687-TRLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/686-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/686-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/686-TRLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/487-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/487-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/496-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/496-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/612-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Door%20Glass/612-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/692-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/694-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/690-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/690-RLB-1L-SW.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/690-TRLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/493-RLB-1L.jpg|https://www.odl.com/hubfs/ODL%20Images/Products/Sidelights/493-RLB-1L.jpg","","Light-Touch Enclosed Blinds|ODL_2012_RLBOperator_ProductSlider|ODL_2012_RLBExtApp_ProductSlider|ODL_2012_RLBOperator2_ProductSlider|Clear|672-RLB-1L|672-RLB-1L-SW|684-RLB-1L|684-RLB-1L-SW|684-TRLB-1L|607-RLB-1L|624-RLB-1L|624-RLB-1L-SW|687-RLB-1L|687-RLB-1L-SW|687-TRLB-1L|686-RLB-1L|686-RLB-1L-SW|686-TRLB-1L|487-RLB-1L|487-RLB-1L-SW|496-RLB-1L|496-RLB-1L-SW|612-RLB-1L|612-RLB-1L-SW|692-RLB-1L|694-RLB-1L-SW|690-RLB-1L|690-RLB-1L-SW|690-TRLB-1L|493-RLB-1L|493-RLB-1L","","","","","","","",""
